    "Consider again the product mix problem: a factory has recipes for producing $n=40$ types of perfume by mixing 5 ingredients. Denote as $P_0=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots{},39\\}$ the set of 40 perfumes, and as $I=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ the set of ingredients. The problem is defined as in part I, with the exception that $A$ and $c$ have more elements. Their value is specified directly in the code snippet after this cell. The first four elements of $c$ and the first four columns of $A$ are the same as in the previous exercise. The availability is the same as in the previous part:\n",

    "3. Repeat task 2 after adding the chosen column; which one should be the sixth variable?\n",
    "4. Solve the problem with __all__ $n$ columns and report the new revenue; before solving it, can you predict if it will be larger or smaller? Why?"
